## Proposal
### Problem Statement: Weather has an impact on people's health and habits, as well as the economy, society, and the environment. The severity of the impact is determined by a number of elements, including the type of weather event, the date of the event, the severity of the event, the duration of the event, and the location of the event. Malaysia has an equatorial climate, which means that the weather is hot and humid most of the year, with plenty of rain. It is one of the Asian countries most sensitive to climate change, therefore weather forecasts are a useful tool for people to prepare ahead and take precautions when necessary. This software provides current weather information as well as forecasts for the future based on the date and time entered by the user. It warns people of severe weather conditions, such as heat waves and heavy rains.
### System Architecture: For the system, it has been decided to use a data base from Kaggle for our data resource and use a mobile as a device. Heroku is the cloud platform used for as a cloud platform, and the ingest data is Django Rest Framework. Thunkable is the website used to create the No-Code App and designing it.
